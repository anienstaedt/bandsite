Canadian Girlfriend is an indie rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The principal members of the band met as short-shorts-wearing cross country running teammates and have been playing together since 2010. 

With lyrics written over lonely winters and melodies crafted in a NE Minneapolis basement, CGF's music ranges from riff-driven indie rock to four-on-the-floor synth-pop. By turns pithy and groovable, they pursue an elusive sweetness alongside the melancholy of fleeting love.

CGF is currently recording its first studio album.
